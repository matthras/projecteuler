###Javascript Algorithms for ProjectEuler Problems
======

Obviously these algorithms contain spoilers, so read at your own risk! There may be multiple algorithms and some commented explanations with links to online resources that explain mathematical concepts or describe smaller algorithms.

#If you are new to programming/coding and want to tackle ProjectEuler problems or run scripts using Javascript:

* Download Recommended Text Editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* In VS Code, hit ` Ctrl+\` ` to bring up the terminal/command prompt.
* Once you've written your script in Javascript and saved it (e.g. example.js), ensure the terminal/command prompt is in the folder you've saved example.js in, simply type `node example.js`

# Notes

* You'll need to `console.log` anything that you want to see in the terminal/command prompt.
* If you've hit an infinite loop or have a script running indefinitely, hit `Ctrl+C` to interrupt it.
